Place your art exactly as follows so everything loads:
- Backgrounds & masks: assets/background_graphics/grasslands_a1.png and grasslands_a1_mask.png ... through d4; temple a1..a5 with masks.
- Player: assets/characters/main_stopped.png, main_walking_up.png, main_walking_down.png, main_walking_left.png, main_walking_right.png
- Villagers: assets/characters/grasslands_villager_1/grasslands_villager_1_stopped.png and ..._walking_<dir>.png; same for grasslands_villager_2
- Merchant: assets/characters/shop_merchant/shop_merchant_stopped.png (merchant doesn't move)
- Enemies: assets/characters/grasslands_enemy_1/grasslands_enemy_1_walking_<dir>.png and ..._stopped.png (same for grasslands_enemy_2)
- Temple enemies: assets/characters/grasslands_temple_enemy/grasslands_temple_enemy_walking_<dir>.png (and stopped)
- Tasks: assets/items/tasks/glasses.png, computer.png
- Map: assets/maps/grasslands_map.png
If a file is missing, the engine shows a placeholder rectangle; once you drop the PNGs in those exact paths, they will render live.
